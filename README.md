1. ### What is TypeScript?
   TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It enables catching errors early through a type system and makes development more efficient by providing powerful tooling.

   **Features:**
   - **Type Safety**: Catch type-related errors during development.
   - **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better code completion and refactoring.
   - **Object-Oriented Programming**: Supports features like classes and interfaces.
   - **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrates with existing JavaScript code.

   **Setting Up TypeScript**
   To set up TypeScript, follow these steps:
   1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   2. **Install TypeScript**: Open your terminal and run:
      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```
   3. **Initialize a TypeScript Project**: Create a new directory for your project and run:
      ```bash
      tsc --init
      ```
   4. **Write TypeScript Code**: Create a `.ts` file and start coding:
      ```typescript
      const greeting: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
      console.log(greeting);
      ```
   5. **Compile TypeScript Code**: Run the TypeScript compiler:
      ```bash
      tsc
      ```
      This will compile your `.ts` files into `.js` files.

   Node.js and npm are essential tools for modern JavaScript development, particularly for server-side and full-stack development.

   **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side scripts, enabling dynamic web        page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. This makes it possible to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code.

   **npm** (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a critical tool for managing JavaScript packages and dependencies.
